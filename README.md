## Info

This is an example of Golang implement WinRM client with PTH.

## How it works?

In [ntlmssp](https://github.com/bodgit/ntlmssp), it always encodes the password to md4 hash in function `ntowfV1`, then we can make a simple logic detection to check if the user passes a hash into it, with that "patch", we can give hash into `ntlmssp` to make the auth structures.

The [winrm](https://github.com/masterzen/winrm) always use `DefaultClientCompatibilityLevel`, so we don't need to do lots of changes in `ntlmssp`.

Why do we need `encryption.go`?

- Because in Windows, winrm is always set `AllowUnencrypted` to false, and the library [winrm](https://github.com/masterzen/winrm) only support `AllowUnencrypted`, which means we can't auth into `winrm` without `winrm set winrm/config/service @{AllowUnencrypted="true"}`, this is not make sense.
- With `encryption.go`, we can auth into `winrm` even without `winrm set winrm/config/service @{AllowUnencrypted="true"}`

## Screenshots
- Without `AllowUnencrypted` in PTH

## Known bugs
- Hash + AllowUnencrypted="true" == Not working
